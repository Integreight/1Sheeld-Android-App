# 1Sheeld: The Arduino Shield #
*A rapid prototyping platform and a revolutionary shield for Arduino*

## What is 1Sheeld? ##
1Sheeld is a platform for Arduino that allows you to tap into your smartphone's sensors and capabilities and lets you use them in your Arduino projects. Basically, It is a hardware shield that sits on top of your Arduino board and communicates over Bluetooth to this Android app, to transfer data between it and your smartphone.


Instead of buying an accelerometer sensor, use the one in your smartphone, want to connect Arduino to the internet? no need to buy a WiFi shield, use your smartphone as a gateway to access the internet. 1Sheeld makes you use all your smartphone's sensors and capabilities for hardware prototyping.


## What can you do with 1Sheeld? ##
The sky is the limit! You have a powerful Android smartphone that can be used to control your RC car, tweet when plants are thirsty, and have fun automating your environment.


## Where can I buy 1Sheeld? ##
It is available through distributors worldwide, check our website to know more: www.1sheeld.com/buy


## What is this app? ##
1Sheeld app is used along with our hardware shield to either control Arduino, read your smartphone's sensors in your Arduino sketch, post on social media, or even control your Android device.


## Does it work with Arduino Mega, Leonardo, Uno and Due? ##
Yup, our shield should work with any Arduino board as long as it has the shields’ form factor and are compatible with Arduino Uno shields in general.


## Is it open source? ##
Yes, all of the schematics, firmware, and this app are open source. Check out our Github account : http://github.com/integreight


## Where can I find your Arduino library and its documentation? ##
